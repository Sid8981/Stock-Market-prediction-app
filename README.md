# Stock Market Prediction App

## Overview
This repository contains a Stock Market Prediction App built with Streamlit. The app uses machine learning models to predict future stock prices based on historical data. It provides an interactive interface for users to input their data and visualize predictions.

## Features
- User-friendly interface with Streamlit
- Input stock data via sidebar sliders
- Visualize prediction results
- View training data statistics
- Evaluate model performance

## Installation
To get started with the Stock Market Prediction App, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-market-prediction-app.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd stock-market-prediction-app
    ```
3. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
4. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
To run the app locally, use the following command:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
Files
app.py: Main application script
stock_data.csv: Sample dataset (replace with your stock market data)
requirements.txt: List of required Python packages
Data
The application uses a sample dataset (stock_data.csv). For stock market prediction, replace this dataset with relevant stock market data, ensuring the necessary columns are present for the model to train and predict.

Model
The app uses a machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest, LSTM) for prediction. Modify the model and parameters in the app.py file as needed to improve performance or adapt to different data.

Visualizations
The app provides visualizations for:

Training data statistics
Scatter plots for feature values
Prediction result visualization
